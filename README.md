git clone https://github.com/OMetaVR/Spotify-recently-played-readme-status.git
cd Spotify-Now-Playing
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Spotify Developer Application

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create an App"
4. Fill in the app name and description
5. Once created, click "Edit Settings"
6. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs and save

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with the values from your Spotify Developer Application.

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The first time you run the application, it will open a web browser for authentication. Log in with your Spotify account and grant the necessary permissions.

### Step 6: Access the Now Playing Display

Once the application is running, you can access your Now Playing display at:

```
http://localhost:10000/now-playing
```

This URL will display an image of your currently playing track, which you can embed in other applications or websites.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, please check the following:
